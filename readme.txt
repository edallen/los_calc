This little application is a Line of Sight calculator for the Tactical Combat Series games by The Gamers. 
It implements the formula from the 3.1 edition of the rules, which should be unchanged from other editions, representing
basic geometry. 

Updated as an app to be saved to an iPhone for convenient use at a game.
