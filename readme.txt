This little application is a Line of Sight calculator for the Tactical Combat Series games by The Gamers. 
It implements the formula from the 3.1 edition of the rules, which should be unchanged from other editions, representing
basic geometry. I run it on my laptop at an offline location so I included jQuery instead of sourcing it from
Google. 

License? jQuery is licensed under their terms. My script is too trivial to need a formal license, do whatever you want with it.
